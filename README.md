# Melanoma-tumor-detection-using-image-processing

Detection of cancer at early state drastically enhances the probability of cure.
The application will differentiate the benign and malignant (cancerous) moles.
Cancerous moles are asymmetrical, have irregular edges and varies its color, using these properties in image processing along with machine learning with a dataset of 500 images, our application will differentiate between the two moles.
